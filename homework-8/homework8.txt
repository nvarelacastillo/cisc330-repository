1. Write a query string with 2 values for www.example.com
www.example.com?location=Paris&year=2024

2. What is meant by escaping a character?
When data comes in from the front end, it needs to be verified to prevent hackers from sending malicious code. The first step is to remove or modify harmful characters that should not be in a value, especially those that could be interpreted as code. This is often done by escaping characters, converting them so theyâ€™re treated as plain text rather than executable code.

3. What are the following HTTP status and their meanings:
a. 200: Okay (request was successful)
b. 400: Bad request (invalid syntax)
c. 401: Unauthorized (server requires user authentication)
d. 403: Forbidden (client request rejected)
e. 404: Not found (No current or hiding of representation)
f. 500: Internal Server Error (unexpected condition that inhibits the request from going through)

4. Why do we need to validate data?
Data needs to be validated to ensure it fits within the defined values for each field. Validation checks that the data is in the correct format, is the right type, and is not empty. This step is essential for maintaining accuracy, preventing errors, and ensuring data is safe and usable.

5. What are sessions and cookies? What do they do?
Sessions store information on the server about the user and their preferences for the duration of a user's visit. In MAMP, session data is stored in the tmp directory within the Apache files. On the other hand, cookies store data about the user directly in a text file on their device. Each time the browser requests a new page from the domain, it sends the data in cookies back to the server through the HTTP header.
