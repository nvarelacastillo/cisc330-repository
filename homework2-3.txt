Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a 1-d layout system, while CSS grid is a 2-d layout system.
In Flexbox, properties are split between parent and child containers.
It aligns items in the main and cross axis while the CSS grid uses a grid system with rows and columns.
The CSS grid web layout model has separate rules for its child and parent containers.
The grid parent defines the columns and rows, while the child decides a grid itemâ€™s placement.
